                        The initial website had bright pinks and purples, with a gradient theme. It was really harsh to look at, and
                        difficult to use since there was no hierarchy of features. I worked closely with the founder during my internship
                        since he wanted to get the branding right, and I wanted to visualize his ideas.

                <div class="three down small">
                    <p class="standard"></p>
                        <p class="standard">I created a variety of colour palettes to see what direction the founder wished to go towards, however we ended up choosing a colour palette 
                            that has the same pink as the original brand, but with a lot of white for visual pacing.
                        </p>
                        <p class="standard">The founder wanted to have illustrations throughout the website, so I created a small mood board for him to get an idea of what he
                            was looking for. I ended up creating a design language for the illustrations that matches the mood board later on.
                        </p>
                        <p class="standard">
                            With the colours and the visual elements arranged, I created the design system which I would
                            reference frequently when creating prototypes. It provided the consistency needed for the
                            new website, since the original version lacked a strong enough brand identity.
                        </p>

                <div class="three smoldown small">
                    <p class="standard">
                        The first iteration I designed had placeholder images instead of the planned
                        illustrations. I wanted to make a more modernized landing page layout where
                        the user is provided with information about Royaltymine. The original website
                        displayed various songs on their landing page so I incorporated that into the
                        design.
                    </p>
                    <p class="standard">
                        The colouring scheme I settled on reminded me of highlighters so a lot of the components
                        of this initial design revolved around "highlighting" specific things. The new white background is more easily digestible to user's
                        in contrast to the original harsh pink and purple background. 
                    </p>

                        We went through many different sketches and ideas when designing the illustrations
                        for the website. By having these sketches, I was able to get helpful feedback, and
                        it helped me explore a few options I would not have thought of if I didn't have them.
                    </p>
                    <p class="standard">
                        I decided to have the main visual elements be shapes representing people.
                        Since I wasn't confident in my ability to design more realistic human
                        proportions, geometric shapes were a great alternative as I could manipulate the expressions 
                        and poses to a great extent.
                    </p>

                    <p class="standard">
                        After repeating this process multiple times, we ended up with
                        three illustrations to work with for the landing page. These
                        illustrations would visualize a story that Royaltymine would tell.
