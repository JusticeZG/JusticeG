            <h2>
                During the winter break, I was visiting different websites that my parents use regularly. One of them being my mom's <a class="lcreate" href="https://www.cornellphysio.ca/">Business Website</a>. As I was going through the different features
                and interfaces I found that I didn't enjoy the experience. Specifically with scheduling an appointment. I was confused about what I was scheduling because there were distinctly different types of appointments with different rates. I was also confused about how to schedule an appointment. So, I decided to redesign her website as a fun side project. I also used this opportunity to learn Figma, an application I have been meaning to learn for a while.
            </h2>
            <h2>
                The only feature on the website was the ability to book an appointment, everything else was information about the clinic (for example services, the staff, location, e.t.c). So I decided to create a mobile version of the website that focuses on this feature.
            </h2>
            <h2>
                During the whole process, I asked my mom for feedback and she gave occasional feedback like the accessibility of some features and general design choices that she would want on her website.
            </h2>
            <h2>
                As this is my first layout design, I am satisfied with the end product. I only planned to redesign this during the first two weeks of my winter break so I did not end up making a heavily detailed prototype.
