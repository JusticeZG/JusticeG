                        I enjoyed playing Ultimate Frisbee every since I joined my elementary school team in grade 5. I loved playing the sport because I got to play with my friends! 
                        In recent years, I joined the Toronto Ultimate Frisbee Club to learn how to play better. This helped me co-captain my highschool team in grade 11, and although we did 
                        not win, it was still a very fun season and I am glad I got involved in the sport.

                        I also enjoy making music with people! I am apart of my local church's worship team and I play bass. I love learning how to play better from others and having the ability to connect with them through music.

                        When I'm not playing the guitar, I'm usually cruising around on a skateboard. I find it therapeutic, and it's a nice break from doing work. It's also very awarding to explore your neighbourhood by just wandering outside from time to time.
