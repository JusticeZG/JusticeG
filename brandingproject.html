                        The branding project is a series of projects in my GBDA101 course. In this course, we were assigned "clients" (who were classmates in the course) to design a brand for.
                        These projects ranged from a poster design, a design pitch book, and an animation. It was not required for our projects to have cohesion, but I liked the direction the brand
                        was initially going after the first project, so I decided to continue with it.</p>

                    <div class="three smoldown small">
                        <p class="standard">The first part of this project was to design a poster and I decided to create the poster by using both Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. My "client" said her design aesthetic is a blend between a vintage look and an Earth-toned color palette. Her main hobby was also dancing.</p>
                        <p class="standard">During my initial sketching phase, I thought that her design aesthetic and her hobby would be very difficult to represent and ran into multiple roadblocks.
                        So, I looked at many posters on Pinterest and took notes on how they used design elements or symbols to represent different things. I soon came up with two ideas, to use the
                        Earth-toned color palette accent a movement-based silhouette. Once I was set in this direction, the posters looked too plain for my liking. It also lacked the feeling of dance and movement that I was going for, so I added hands poised and contorted in various poses to accentuate this meaning.</p>
                        <p class="standard">After showing this to my Professor, he said that it would look great in a series of different posters and that it had potential as a marketing campaign.
                        Taking his criticism into consideration, I strayed away from my initial color palette and leaned towards colors that resembled dancing, but were still easy on the eyes.</p>

                <div class="three smoldown small">
                    <p class="standard">After the poster, we were assigned to create a logo for our client, but before we could start, we had to submit a mood board. I decided to style the mood board
                    based on three main takeaways that I got from my client during my interview with her:</p>
                <img src="images/brandingproject_04.png">
                    <p class="standard">I included one of the posters that I created because I would be referencing them for inspiration during the sketching phase of the logo. Most of the pictures
                    that I put on the mood board were taken from Pinterest and were selected because they would make the mood board diverse and unique.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="container6">
        <div class="three smoldown small">
            <p class="standard">Once I finished the mood board, I started to sketch out designs and ideas for how I would want the logo to look. At first, I was playing around with different font styles with my client's initials to see if I could get any more ideas. However, I didn't like any of the ideas I was thinking of and started to reference the mood board more intently.</p>
            <p class="standard">After a bit of brainstorming, I started to settle on an idea that I believed would look good if well executed. The idea was loosely based on the rings of a tree trunk, and the rings would be shaped into the client's initials. I liked the idea on paper, so I went onto Adobe Illustrator and started to make mockups. Unfortunately, I didn't like how it was beginning to turn out so I scrapped it and went back to sketching.</p>
            <p class="standard">I started to experiment with different fonts again on Adobe Illustrator and found a font that flows into itself very nicely.
            I experimented more and created a very fluid logo with my client's initials.</p>

            <div class="three smoldown small">
                <p class="standard">After creating the logo, I needed to create multiple mockups of the logo on various products. I also needed to include the logo, the mockups, and an overall briefing of the design in a design pitch.</p>
                <p class="standard">Once I showed my Professor my progress, he told me to play around with the logo some more. So, I went back into Adobe Illustrator and played around with different patterns that the logo could create. In the end, I created two variant logos, one for a "Lifestyle" aspect of the brand, and another for "Luxury".</p>

                    <p class="standard">I didn't have much experience animating, but I had some knowledge on how to manipulate shapes and forms to create a motion. Watching cartoons and anime also inspired me on different effects to play around with. So I wanted to create a simple yet dynamic ball animation for the dancing brand that I created for my client.
                    </p>
                    <p class="standard">I showed an early storyboard to my professor and he told me to add music or some sort of background noise. I had no experience in producing or creating any music but I thought that I would give it a shot. I ended up using a free online website to create a hip-hop beat that would become the basis of the animation.

                    I did not learn that much from this project as I would have liked to, in fact, I used this project as a
                    benchmark to apply the skills that I learned from high school. This will be used as a reference project to see how far I have gotten in my design journey since it's the first project where I put a considerable amount of passion into it.
                </p>
                <p class="standard">
                    I think that learning the background of my "client" really helped with the basic structure of this project as
                    I was able to have an outline of what I wanted things to look like. Contrasting to other projects, I have had no consideration of how certain design elements would impact the overall feeling of the design. Moving forward,
                    I will be applying this much more frequently since it made the final product look more cohesive.
